During this difficult time of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare organizations and medical institutions are inundated with requests and demands from the general public. As an AI chatbot company based in Silicon Valley,[ Juji](https://juji.io) would like to lend them a helping hand. We are currently offering our chatbot services free-of-charge to these institutions.

Juji's platform automatically answers user questions in Facebook Messenger or on a website based on a curated list of questions and answers. For example,[ a group of volunteers from the New Voices Program](https://www.newvoicesnasem.org/post/using-artificial-intelligence-to-combat-misinformation-about-covid-19) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine have used Juji to create an AI chatbot,[ Jennifer](https://www.newvoicesnasem.org/jennifer-ai-chatbot), to clarify misinformation and answer public's questions about COVID-19.

We are offering the same free service to all health organizations or medical institutions, so that critical health information can reach more people in this time of need. With extended home stays, online media becomes a significant source of information. We can help set up a free chatbot in Facebook Messenger associated with public Facebook Page or a chatbot on the institution's Website.

Setting up a chatbot using the Juji platform is fast and easy, requires minimal technical expertise from the users. For instance, the [National Alliance on Mental Illness](https://www.namilongbeach.org/)[\- Long Beach Area](https://www.namilongbeach.org/) has added a Juji powered AI chatbot, Julie, on their homepage to help answer questions. The work was completed in a single day under Juji's guidance, and was done without involving other IT personnels.

If you are reading this, please forward this information to any relevant institutions, so that this new and free automated information channel becomes accessible to more people. The adoption of an AI chatbot will help alleviate any manpower shortages while reserving precious human resources for more urgent matters, e.g., coordinating logistics and caring for patients. The time to act is now.
