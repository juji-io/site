Although powerful large language models (LLMs) like GPT can power a chatbot with abilities to interpret and generate response to user input, they do not really teach the chatbot how to carry out an effective and pleasant dialog with a user. Additionally, AI is far from perfect and there are always cases where AI cannot handle or handles wrong. Hence the role of a conversational AI designer is critical as they put their wisdom and creativity into an AI chatbot and ensure effective dialogs between AI and its users.

In the article “Towards User-Centric Guidelines for Chatbot Conversational Design,” published in the International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, researchers Geovana Ramos and EDNA DIAS CANEDO at Universidade de Brasília conducted a systematic literature review to uncover best practices in conversational AI design around three areas: 

**N﻿aturalness**

A chatbot should engage in conversations naturally by:

1. Presenting itself as a virtual agent with a name and purpose at the start of the conversation.
2. Addressing the user by their name when possible.
3. Supporting small talk or chitchat, such as greetings and expressions of praise or thanks.
4. Echoing user input in responses when appropriate.
5. Conveying information in a conversational, casual tone.
6. Using alternative ways of saying the same thing, avoiding repetitive messages.

**E﻿motionality**

A chatbot should express and understand emotions to build deeper connections with users by:

1. Using punctuations, images, GIFs, and emojis to convey emotions and make conversations more engaging.
2. Showing empathy by adapting responses based on the user’s feelings.
3. Incorporating humor appropriately.

**Transparency**

A chatbot should be honest and clear about its capabilities to set the right user expectations by:

1. Presenting its purpose and capabilities at the start of the conversation.
2. Acknowledging its limitations upfront or after a failure.
3. Suggesting conversation topics to keep the user on track of what the chatbot can do.
4. Asking for clarification when it fails to understand user input.
