JumpStart® is the leader in creating interactive experiences that enrich, entertain and educate. It produces high-quality educational games that provide positive, safe and fun experiences. Their games have earned the trust of millions of teachers, parents, and respected organizations such as Common Sense Media and The National Parenting Center.

# The Challenge

As online learning has become increasingly more important, the JumpStart team developed and launched a new online service called [Activity Studio](https://activity.jumpstart.com/#/). This  service enables teachers to create, share, and use fun, game-based learning in their teaching activities. On the other hand, these online learning materials can help improve student engagements and boost students' learning interests. 

Because it is a new service, the team faced several challenges. First, it was time consuming to manually respond to user questions because it did not have a comprehensive user manual or FAQs.  Second, it is unclear why certain users abandoned their activities and there was no easy way to engage with such users during their activities and collect their feedback so their feedback can be used to improve the service. 

# Implementation

To address the two challenges mentioned above, the service team designed and implemented a chatbot, called Johnny, which performs three tasks:

1. Anwer user questions about the service
2. Elicit user input
3. Teach user key service features

There are two versions of Johnny, [one serving teachers](https://activity.jumpstart.com/#/jsaactivity) while the [other serving students](https://activity.jumpstart.com/#/student). 

## Anwer user questions about the service

Like any new service deployed, initial users (i.e., teachers and students) normally have questions regarding the service. For example, the users want to know how the service can help them or a particular feature of the services. Since such user questions can be quite diverse, Jonny was designed to enable users to ask free-text questions instead of being forced to traverse a fixed tree-based menu and find help. 

As shown in the screenshot below, a user can ask free-text questions, including  questions that require multi-turn interactions.

## Elicit User Input

While Jonny helps answer user questions and solve user issues, it was also designed to ask questions and elicit users' input. For example, Johnny asks teachers which grade and subject they are teaching and their NPS score about Activity Studio (see screenshot below).

This chatbot behavior is quite similar to human-driven call center services. When a customer calls a call center for support, the customer may be asked to fill in a survey to provide his/her feedback about the service received.  

## Teach Users Key Features of New Service

In addition to answering and asking user questions, the chatbot Johnny also serves as a "service guide" to teach users the key features of Activity Studio. As shown below, it informs teachers about the most frequently used service features and encourage the teachers to check them out.
