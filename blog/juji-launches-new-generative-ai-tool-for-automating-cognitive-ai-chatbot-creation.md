[Juji](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fjuji.io&esheet=53362217&newsitemid=20230315005247&lan=en-US&anchor=Juji+Inc.&index=1&md5=b68315b6bec874fdf5d4d89c28964c5a) announced the launch of its new generative AI tool that enables any organization to rapidly generate custom AI chatbots with no code or additional IT resources. These AI chatbots are powered with cognitive intelligence—advanced human soft skills like active listening and reading between the lines, and can be used to scale human teams and automate high-touch, high-stakes engagements 24x7.

"Unlike other generative AI platforms, which create static content like text and images, Juji can generate autonomous AI chatbots that are customized to a specific workflow and proprietary knowledge," said Dr. Huahai Yang, co-founder and CTO of Juji. “While other chatbot companies focus on using generative AI technology like GPT-3 to teach chatbots language skills, Juji uniquely combines generative AI with [computational psychology](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businesswire.com%2Fnews%2Fhome%2F20230124005074%2Fen%2FJuji-Inc.-Powers-Auburn-Led-Five-University-Study-on-Validating-Personality-Scores-Inferred-by-an-AI-Chatbot&esheet=53362217&newsitemid=20230315005247&lan=en-US&anchor=computational+psychology&index=2&md5=f10206eee55cc04887041c5d54f61310) to power chatbots with advanced human soft skills in addition to language skills. As a result, Juji chatbots behave empathetically and responsibly."


One-on-one, high-touch engagements help organizations aid their prospects and customers in high-stakes decision making, but they are difficult to scale. With Juji's generative AI tool, organizations across industries including [education](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fjuji.io%2Feducation-chatbot%2F&esheet=53362217&newsitemid=20230315005247&lan=en-US&anchor=education&index=3&md5=b0fe102fe03848fa345ef9bfa17633c1), [talent management ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fjuji.io%2Fhr-chatbot%2F&esheet=53362217&newsitemid=20230315005247&lan=en-US&anchor=talent+management&index=4&md5=90299c417c25891e146e568d22653b53)and [healthcare](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fjuji.io%2Fhealthcare-chatbot%2F&esheet=53362217&newsitemid=20230315005247&lan=en-US&anchor=healthcare&index=5&md5=0419f2b419ccfaff49f470afcf6dff9d) can now auto-generate custom AI chatbots rapidly to scale out such engagements. These generated Juji AI chatbots can proactively engage with their users in a two-way conversation, infer their personality traits in real-time, and guide them to make important life decisions based on their unique personality (e.g., choosing a career).

The global generative AI market size is estimated at [$8.65 billion in 2022](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsports.yahoo.com%2Fgenerative-ai-market-grow-cagr-181700421.html&esheet=53362217&newsitemid=20230315005247&lan=en-US&anchor=%248.65+billion+in+2022&index=6&md5=41e188ed4dd7366e89b3fec85f77c06c), growing to $168.62 billion by 2032. While organizations are eager to harness the power of generative AI like ChatGPT, they are also concerned with the how-tos and risks.

“Generative AI is very powerful. However, not every organization knows how to leverage the power.” said Dr. Michelle Zhou, co-founder and CEO of Juji, “Not only does our new tool enable any organizations, with or without AI or IT expertise, to harness the power of generative AI in a unique way and safely, but it also enables organizations to automate high-value engagements with empathy. This is a significant advancement towards democratizing AI and bridging the AI divide."
