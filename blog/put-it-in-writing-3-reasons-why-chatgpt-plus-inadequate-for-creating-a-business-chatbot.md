W﻿ith the launch of ChatGPT plus, more and more people or organizations started to build their own chatbots. While ChatGPT plus provides a natural language interface for almost anyone to build a chatbot, it is inadequate for building a chatbot in a business context.

Why? The rationale is quite straightforward.  In a business context, when we negotiate a business contract or agreement, we often say "put it in writing" for the purpose of recording important terms and make them official. The same principle should also apply to regulating an AI chatbot's behavior especially when the chatbot is to act on behalf of an organization or business.

Unfortunately, a prompt-driven tool like ChatGPT Plus does not put an AI chatbot’s behavior in writing, hence it is inadequate for building a chatbot for business use.\
\
In the rest of the blog, we outline 3 reasons why it is important to put AI chatbot/chatbot behavior in writing, especially in a business context.\
\
#Reason 1 Ensure the integrity of AI chatbot behavior\
\
AI is far from perfect and makes mistakes from time to time. Let's assume that a health science researcher uses ChatGPT Plus to create an AI chatbot to interview patients and gather critical patient information. If such an AI chatbot is created and deployed solely based on the researcher's prompt describing the interview process, the AI chatbot will most likely behave differently with each interviewee since each conversation will be generated on the fly, and there is NO guarantee that the AI chatbot will even ask the same question in every conversation!\
\
Let's look at another example in education where an AI chatbot is created to give interactive tutorials on certain learning content. If an instructor just uses a prompt to instruct an AI chatbot to deliver such a tutorial, the AI chatbot may not even follow the same tutorial steps with each student.\
\
The culprit of such inconsistent AI behavior is the nature of large language models (LLMs) like GPT because they produce behavior (e.g., questions to ask users or answers to give users) based on probability distributions, which imply inherent uncertainty.\
\
If an AI chatbot is created for entertainment purpose, inconsistent or uncertain AI behavior may be tolerated or even be a good thing. However it is unacceptable for conducting a rigorous scientific research study or conducting organization communications, where AI behavior should be consistent and appropriate at all times.\
\
To ensure the integrity or consistency of AI chatbot or chatbot behavior, a good practice is to put the AI chatbot's behavior often in the form of a workflow in writing to make sure it follows the flow and behaves consistently with all users
