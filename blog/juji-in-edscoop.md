EDSCOOP, the leading media featuring latest information technology for higher education, published [a story](https://edscoop.com/ai-chatbot-juji-higher-education/) about Juji and Juji's [cognitive AI assistants](https://juji.io/#juji-smarts) for the higher education sector. 

The story mentioned "Juji’s stand-out feature is its conversational flexibility, a design approach rooted in decades of linguistic and AI [research](https://nlp.stanford.edu/acvogel/groszsidner.pdf). While it’s common for commercial chatbots to get stuck when confronted with an uncooperative or confused interlocutor, Juji employs human-centered design, ... politely responding to off-topic input, but not losing sight of the interaction’s purpose."

The story also highlighted a potential use case of Juji cognitive AI assistants for helping university counselors, "Chatbots can collect patient (student) history before an appointment, saving valuable session time and providing the counselor with a “cheat sheet” of what’s bothering the student."
