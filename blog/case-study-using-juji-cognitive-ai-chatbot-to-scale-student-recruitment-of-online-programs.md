[The Gies College of Business](https://giesbusiness.illinois.edu/) at University of Illinois is a leader in [shaping the business education landscape and democratizing business education](https://poetsandquants.com/2022/01/17/10-business-schools-to-watch-in-2022/10/) with a top-ranked, highly successful online MBA program, [the iMBA program](https://onl). The program was launched in 2016 starting with 116 students and has grown rapidly now with over 4600 students. The program has earned a 97% student satisfaction rating, a retention rate of 95%, and the graduates seeing pay raise by 21% on average.

# **The Challenge**

Just like any fast-growing enterprises, one of the main challenges for the iMBA program is to scale its operations to help increasingly more students, both prospective and enrolled students, with limited resources. In particular, the program's limited number of recruitment staff members had to repeatedly answer tens of thousands of questions from prospective students as well as advise them about the program offerings, admission criteria, and the application process. Moreover, there was not an effective way to understand the interests or needs of prospective students, for example, whether they are interested in a degree program or getting a course certificate. 

# **The Solution**

To address the challenges mentioned above, Professor Brooke Elliott, the Associate Dean of the College, who oversees the school's online programs, decided to enlist the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate the repetitive work and reduce staff burdens. Professor Elliott stated “*We have a handful of recruitment staff members who need to answer tens of thousands of questions from prospective students in addition to their other responsibilities such as advising students. A chatbot solution could help us automate certain operations so we can meet increasing student demands while keeping our staff happy*." She wished to explore how AI could help scale out their fast-growing online programs, satisfying both students while making staff members happier at the same time. 

After watching a quick Juji demo that showed how easy and fast one could set up and maintain a chatbot with no code and no IT resources required, Elliott acknowledged “*this seems easy and our recruitment staff can definitely handle this on their own*”, and then decided to give Juji a try. The Assistant Director of the Admissions and Recruitment team, Myranda Crist, led the team in designing and implementing a chatbot, called Alma, which sits on the program's main web page and performs three tasks:

1. Answer prospective students' questions about the iMBA program
2. 2. Elicit prospective students' information, such as their program interest
3. 3. Inform prospective students the key information about the program

The implementation included two parts, defining the main workflow of Alma as well as teaching Alma how to answer frequently asked student questions.  Designing the main workflow of Alma was rather straightforward: the team used [Juji Studio](https://juji.io/no-coding-ai-chatbot-builder/), a no-coding AI chatbot design tool, to [build the main chat flow](https://juji.io/blog/a-step-to-step-guide-how-to-make-a-multi-purpose-chatbot-no-coding-required/) of Alma based on a template called AI Program Assistant, which already includes a set of conversation topics related to the three tasks mentioned above and a set of program related FAQs. 

As shown in the screenshots below, for example, the first conversation topic (T0) after the welcome message (Welcome) is to invite a prospective student to ask questions and the second topic (T1) is to ask the student if s/he wishes to subscribe to an email list to receive periodical program updates or reminders (e.g., upcoming application deadline).

The screenshot above shows that after sending a welcome message, the AI assistant will invite a website visitor to ask questions (T0). This message also includes a function (help-message-faq) that will automatically generate help messages to inform a visitor what the AI knows. The screenshot below shows what this message looks like in a chat.
