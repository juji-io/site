# How quickly can I build my own chatbot powered by GPT-4 on Juji? What does it take to build one?

In my [previous blog](https://juji.io/blog/can-i-build-my-chatbot-with-gpt-4-how-hard-is-it/), I talked about what it takes to build a chatbot using GPT-4, including the engineering efforts required and a rough cost and time estimate. Although it is non-trivial to build a practical chatbot solution for real-world applications, with the right tools, one can build a custom chatbot solution quickly to take full advantage of the state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4.

For the past several years, we at Juji have been building [Juji Studio](https://juji.io/no-code-ai-chatbot-builder/), an AI chatbot design tool that enables anyone to build their custom chatbots with #NOCODE. Now [with the integration of GPT-4](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/juji-launches-generative-ai-tool-130000308.html), Juji Studio can enable you to build your custom chatbot even faster and better.

In this blog, I will outline how you can use Juji to quickly build a custom chatbot in each of the five categories mentioned in my last blog. As seen below, you can build these custom chatbots powered by proprietary content and the capabilities of GPT-4 without writing any code or any IT resources.

# Type I: Chitchat Chatbots

Although chitchat chatbots are not typical business solutions, you can build them on Juji easily.

## Use GPT-4 to Generate Chatbot Messages

Since GPT-4 is integrated with Juji Studio, it can be used to interpret user input and answer user questions whenever appropriate.  For example, you can use the basic Juji customer service template  (see screenshot below) to create a chitchat chatbot that will let GPT-4 handle user input.
