## Generative AI: A Revolutionary Tool for Businesses?

Lately, it's nearly impossible to go a day without encountering headlines about generative AI technologies and their applications like ChatGPT or AutoGPT. AI has become red hot again, and its hotness is astonishing: suddenly almost everyone wants to jump on the AI bandwagon.

As an advocate for the power of large language models (LLMs), I believe that generative AI carries immense potential. In fact, these models have already demonstrated
their practical value in enhancing personal productivity. For instance, I have incorporated code generated by the models in my work and even used
GPT-4 to proofread this blog post.

The pressing question now is: **how can businesses, small or large, aren't involved in the creation of these large language models capitalize on the power of generative AI to improve their bottom line?**  

Unfortunately, there is a chasm between using LLMs for personal productivity gain and monetizing LLMs for business profit. Like developing any business solution, there is much more than meets the eye. Just using the example of creating a chatbot solution with GPT-4, it can easily [takes months and costs millions of dollars](https://juji.io/blog/can-i-build-my-chatbot-with-gpt-4-how-hard-is-it/). So organizations must decide whether they want to heavily invest in in-house development or collaborate with a vendor. 

With many businesses including many enterprises that have scarce IT and engineering resources, in-house development may not be an option (BTW, using English as a programming language is still a hype for creating business solutions). Their only option would be working with a vendor. But how to evaluate and choose the right one? 

The rest of my article will outline the challenges and opportunities for businesses to leverage generative AI for business gains,  providing a roadmap for entrepreneurs, corporate executives, as well as investors  looking to unlock the value of generative AI in the business context. 

Before we delve into the specifics, let's first establish a clear understanding
of the fundamental context surrounding generative AI.

## Consistent Business Needs in the AI Era

While the technology landscape is an integral part of the business environment,
the core principles of an enterprise do not solely depend on technology.
Business objectives remain constant, irrespective of generative AI advancements.
In other words, a well-run business will continue to prosper, and a poorly
managed one will still struggle, regardless of the emergence of tools like GPT.

The expectation for AI to enhance efficiency and value capture in businesses
remains unaltered, regardless of a specific AI technology's arrival. The concept
of AI assistants in the business world has been around for decades. Throughout
this time, there have been multiple highs and lows in terms of AI implementation
in businesses. The current wave of AI technology should not be seen as a
fundamental shift.

A common misconception is that generative AI technologies like GPT level the
playing field, making domain expertise less critical or even irrelevant. While
this may be partially true for some creative fields, such as marketing
copywriting or illustration, it does not hold for most areas requiring in-depth
domain knowledge. For instance, it is highly unlikely that ChatGPT could replace
a CFA anytime soon \[1].

The analogy of a competition between a powered truck and a horse-drawn carriage
is not applicable here. A horse-drawn carriage does not benefit from a powered
truck, but a domain expert can indeed benefit from using GPT. It would be
misguided to assume that a layperson with access to GPT could outperform a
domain expert who also utilizes GPT in a specialized task. For example, a
layperson may not know how to prompt GPT effectively, assess the quality of its
output, or refine the prompt to obtain the desired results.

## Valuable Lessons from Past AI Deployments

One reason to exercise caution when working with generative AI is that
controlling this technology remains an active research area and is not yet
user-friendly.

A well-known and challenging issue with generative AI is hallucination, or the
tendency to generate false or harmful output. Despite rapid improvements in the
power and quality of generative AI, advancements in truthfulness have been
incremental. While the debate over whether this is a fundamental weakness of
generative AI continues among academics, a look at the current state reveals
that even the latest state-of-the-art models, like Dromedary, which outperforms
GPT-4, can only achieve less than 70% accuracy on the TruthfulQA benchmark \[3].
This level of accuracy is not sufficient for most business settings.

Additionally, there are concerns surrounding privacy and security. For instance,
Samsung recently banned the use of ChatGPT \[2].

The experiences and lessons learned from past AI deployments are still
applicable and valuable, as they faced similar challenges. Discarding the
past efforts to encode domain knowledge and the tools developed to handle complex
business cases would be wasteful.

The current wave of generative AI can be likened to a more powerful CPU. If you
have already built a computer, you can simply plug in the new CPU to boost
performance. This is faster than building a computer from scratch around a new
processor. When selecting a vendor, it's helpful to see if they have a track
record of success. The decision essentially boils down to whether you trust
someone who has never built a computer to utilize the new powerful CPU, or if
you prefer someone with prior experience in building computers.

## Technical Ingredients for Successful AI Deployment

As the CTO of an AI company, I have witnessed firsthand the challenges and
rewards of deploying generative AI in real-world business settings. Based on my
experience, I have identified three key areas of technical competence that are
crucial for a successful implementation of generative AI solutions.

### 1. Agent Framework

An agent does not only respond to user requests, it may also take
actions proactively on users behalf. An effective agent framework forms the foundation of a generative AI system,
allowing it to communicate and interact with users and other systems in a
meaningful way. This framework should encompass several components:

* **Perceptors and actuators**: These essential components serve as the AI
  system's eyes, ears, mouth and hands, enabling it to perceive the environment and take
  actions accordingly. For instance, perceptors might include natural language
  processing capabilities, while actuators could involve generating text or
  controlling other software tools. Generate AI excels in this aspect.
* **Control Unit**: This component should be able to coordinate the perceptors
  and actuators. A well-designed control unit is vital for managing natural
  language understanding, generation, and reasoning within the AI system. The power,
   expressiveness and flexibility of the control unit is critical.
   There are some general open source implmentation of control unit, such as
    LangChain, but many use cases require customized control unit.
* **Working memory**: Just like humans, AI systems need a working memory to
  maintain context during interactions. This component should be able to store
  and retrieve short-term information, allowing the AI system to respond
  accurately and consistently to user inputs. In order to process and manage the
  vast amounts of high-dimensional data generated by AI systems, a vector
  database is essential for building working memory. This database should be optimized for handling
  embeddings and other complex data structures, ensuring that the AI system can
  efficiently access and utilize the information it needs.
* **Customizable Plugins**: Seamless integration with third-party tools and
  services is crucial for maximizing the AI system's capabilities. By
  incorporating external resources, the system can expand its functionality and
  offer a more comprehensive solution to users. These extensions should enable
  access to customer data and provide additional functionality, ensuring that
  the AI system remains adaptable and relevant in a variety of use-cases.

### 2. No-Code Platform

In addition to the large amount of training data, the success of ChatGPT is
largely due to the " Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback" (RLHF),
highlighting the importance of incorporating human input in AI solutions. To
ensure a seamless collaboration between AI and human expertise, a no-code
platform should be implemented.

* **Human UI**: A user-friendly, no-code interface allows business users to
  interact with and manage the AI system without requiring programming
  expertise. This empowers non-technical personnel to harness the power of AI,
  enabling a broader adoption of the technology within the organization.
*  **Test and Evaluation** : Comprehensive testing and evaluation processes should be in place to ensure
  that the AI system meets quality standards and business requirements. Regular
  evaluations help to identify areas for improvement and drive the ongoing
  development of the AI system. Tools such as dashboard visualization should be provided to facilitate these processes.
* **Live human integration**: In situations where the AI system is unable to
  provide a satisfactory response or solution, a smooth integration with live
  human agents is essential. This ensures that businesses can consistently
  deliver the desired outcomes and maintain a high level of customer
  satisfaction.

### 3. Infrastructure

A robust infrastructure is the backbone of a successful AI deployment,
supporting the system's performance, security, and scalability:

*  **DevOps and Scaling** : A DevOps approach to AI deployment facilitates streamlined system maintenance, 
  updates, and scaling. By closely integrating development and operations teams,
  businesses can rapidly adapt to changing demands and ensure that their AI
  system remains agile and responsive.
* **Security and Compliance**  : Ensuring the security and compliance of the AI system is crucial for
  maintaining trust and confidence among users. Businesses must prioritize
  safeguarding sensitive data and adhering to industry-specific regulations,
  demonstrating their commitment to protecting user privacy and upholding
  ethical AI practices.

## Conclusion

As generative AI continues to revolutionize the business landscape, choosing the
right AI vendor becomes increasingly crucial for organizations looking to
harness the technology's full potential. To make an informed decision,
businesses should evaluate potential vendors based on their competence in three
critical areas: an effective agent framework, a seamless no-code platform for
human-AI collaboration, and a robust infrastructure to support performance,
security, and scalability.

By carefully selecting a vendor with proven expertise in these domains,
organizations can ensure a successful deployment of generative AI solutions
tailored to their specific needs. This, in turn, will help enterprises drive
innovation, increase productivity, and gain a competitive edge in an
increasingly AI-driven market.

In conclusion, as businesses navigate the rapidly evolving world of generative
AI, partnering with a vendor that excels in these three key areas will pave the
way for success. By diligently evaluating potential partners and their
capabilities, enterprises can make strategic decisions that unlock the power of
generative AI and turn it into gold for their organization.
