By the Merriam-Webster dictionary, conversation is defined as an "oral exchange of sentiments, observations, opinions, or ideas".  Because of the exchange, one-on-one conversations are perhaps the most effective way for humans to engage with one another. 

However, human-driven conversations cannot scale. From our conversations with universities, we learn that it is not unusual for an admissions office to have only four to five staff members, who might need to handle over 40,0000 incoming student inquiries, not to mention that many such inquiries are repetitive on the same topic , e.g., program requirements or application process. Additionally, universities wish to learn more about prospective students who made inquiries, such as their interest and expectations, so university staff can better follow up with the students (e.g., inviting them to apply for a program or scheduling an interview). So what capabilities must a chatbot have in order to help universities automate such engagements but without losing a human touch? 

# What is a Conversational Chatbot

Powered by cognitive intelligence—an advanced, human-like Artificial Intelligence (AI), a conversational chatbot is also known as a cognitive AI assistant, trained with human conversation skills to possess three key conversation capabilities.

## A Conversational Chatbot That Supports Two-Way Communication

We’ve all had the experience with a chatbot where we are clicking buttons and being forced to follow a path that leads nowhere.  Frustrated, we give up and try to ask a question directly in the chat window.  The chatbot, however confused, responds that it does not understand our input. This is a typical one-way exchange, where a chatbot tries to dictate the whole conversation by following a rigid, pre-defined chat flow, which often leaves users frustrated and unhelped.

In another scenario, a chatbot might open up a conversation with a phrase like "How may I help you?" What happens next is also quite familiar: after texting a question, we receive a chatbot response "Sorry I'm not sure I understand, would you mind rephrasing your question?" Left clueless, we don't know how to rephrase the question and are also afraid no matter how we rephrase the question, the chatbot still could not understand. So we give up. This is another typical one-way exchange, where a chabot tries to let users drive the conversation without providing any guidance, which often results in failed conversations because of today's technology limitations. 

In contrast, conversational chatbots support two-way exchanges, delivering more human-like conversational experiences. Specifically, conversational chatbots can take initiatives and guide a conversation while actively listening to users and allowing users to take initiatives during the conversation. The example below shows a two-way conversation between a chatbot and a student who is inquiring about financial aid.
