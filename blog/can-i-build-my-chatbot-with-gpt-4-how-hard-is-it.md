# Can I build my own chatbot using GPT-4? How hard is it?

With the popularity of [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) and more recently [AutoGPT](https://autogpt.net/), more and more organizations (or individuals) are considering the adoption of a chatbot for their website or proprietary applications (e.g., a learning program website or a mobile healthcare application). The pressing question is: should I build or buy one?

The answer is: it really depends on what kind of chatbot you want to have. To determine what kind of chatbot you want, the questions like the following but not limited to the following must be answered:

* What kind of tasks is my chatbot set to accomplish? 
* Whom will the chatbot interact with? How many users will use the chatbot?  
* What kind of knowledge must it have? Where does the knowledge come from? 
* Who would maintain or update the chatbot?
* What kind of progress report should the chatbot generate and where will the reports be stored? 

When I was getting my Master's in Computer Science, I naively thought a chatbot was just a machine learning model that can be set up easily and rapidly. After spending 5+ years on building chatbots for business organizations in their real-world applications, I realized that building a usable and useful chatbot takes much greater effort beyond enabling natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG), or even beyond implementing AI capabilities.

# Requirements for Building a Chatbot with GPT-4

Although chatbots can be used in a wide range of applications and industries, their main purpose can be roughly categorized into five types. For each type, I will describe how GPT-4 (which has the latest NLU and NLG capabilities) or an equivalent large language model (LLM) can be used to power a chatbot in that category, including

* the simplest implementation, and 
* additional developments that one might want to consider to make a chatbot useful and usable for real-world applications.

## Type I: Chitchat Chatbots

As a student in computer science, this was what I had in mind: a chatbot that entertains you with its humorous sentences on a lonely night (see screenshot below).

If you have access to a LLM like GPT-4, this kind of chatbot is relatively easy to set up. Actually I just asked GPT-4 "What are the steps to create a chatbot using GPT-4?" Below is its answer.

Even though it's wrong about its own release status (GPT-4 is already released!), the main idea was rather straightforward: one can use the GPT-4 API to get input from a user,  pass on the user input to get the chatbot response, and then relay the chatbot response back to the user.

> As of now, GPT-4 has not been released yet. However, the steps to create a chatbot using GPT-4 would likely be similar to those using GPT-3. Here are the steps to create a chatbot using a hypothetical GPT-4:
>
> 1. Access GPT-4 API: Once GPT-4 is released, sign up for access to its API. You might need to request access and wait for approval, depending on the availability and terms provided by OpenAI.
>
> 2. Familiarize yourself with the documentation: Go through the GPT-4 API documentation to understand how to interact with the model, set parameters, and send requests.
>
> 3. Choose a programming language and library: Pick a programming language you're comfortable with and a library that supports GPT-4 API integration, such as Python with the OpenAI library.
>
> 4. Set up the development environment: Install the required libraries and tools for your chosen language and set up a local development environment or use an online environment, such as Google Colab.
>
> 5. Initialize GPT-4 API connection: Use your API key to establish a connection with the GPT-4 API, typically through an API client provided by the library or by setting up your own HTTP requests.
>
> 6. Define the chatbot interaction: Determine how you want your chatbot to interact with users. This might include setting up a prompt system, parsing user input, and defining the chatbot's responses based on the context.
>
> 7. Send requests to GPT-4: Create a function that sends user input to the GPT-4 API and retrieves generated responses. Adjust parameters such as temperature, max tokens, and top_p to control the output's creativity and length.
>
> 8. Process and present responses: Parse the response from GPT-4 and extract the relevant information. Present the response to the user in a user-friendly format, such as a chat interface or a voice-based system.
>
> 9. Optimize and iterate: Test your chatbot and gather feedback from users. Iterate on your design, improve context handling, and tweak GPT-4 parameters to enhance the chatbot's performance.
>
> 10. Integrate with platforms: If desired, integrate your chatbot with messaging platforms, websites, or apps to reach a wider audience and provide a seamless user experience.
>
> Remember that the specific steps and implementation details might vary depending on the GPT-4's features and improvements over GPT-3.

This sounds magical: now you could have a humorous chit-chat chatbot on your platform to entertain your visitors. However, what if your chatbot gives out erroneous information just as it did about its own release? What if your chatbot responded to your visitors that other brands offer better products/services than yours? The bad news is that LLMs including GPT-4 [hallucinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)) and might give false statements of fact with confidence. If you are a business owner, you might not want your visitors to get the wrong idea about you or your brand.

Then what if someone tries to attack your chatbot maliciously? Or what if a huge number of users suddenly appeared on your website and overwhelmed your chatbot? You will then need to think about system security and safety, as well as resource scaling just like building any other type of computer applications and systems.

## Type II: Custom Q&A Chatbots

After reading the above that directly using GPT-4's answers to user questions might not be a good idea for your brand or business, now you want to inject your own information into your chatbot so it can respond to users appropriately. In fact, one of the most common chatbot uses is a custom Q&A chatbot that uses proprietary information to answer user questions. For example, universities want a custom chatbot on their website to answer prospect or student questions about their learning programs (see below an example chat) or hospitals want a chatbot in their mobile app to answer patient questions about their medical services.
