In his podcast, [Brent Csutoras](https://www.brentcsutoras.com/) at Search Engine Journal had a conversation with Dr. Michelle Zhou, co-founder and CEO of Juji on how cognitive intelligence will reshape the chatbot industry.

"We have heard for years that Chatbots are the future and although we have seen some significant progress in the concept and application, they are still impersonal and not as helpful as we had hoped they would be." 

In response to Brent's question, Michelle talked about what "cognitive intelligence" means in the AI world and how it would enable chatbots to be much more effective--being both empathetic and responsible in their tasks to truly understand and help their users.
