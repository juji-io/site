Are you considering an AI chatbot for your business? A simple Google search will present you with hundreds if not thousands of AI chatbot platforms!  Almost all of them claim that they are powered by generative AI and all seem to offer similar features, giving the first impression that any of them would do the job. 


In reality, not every chatbot platform is created equal or is a perfect fit for the tasks you have at hand. For example, many of our customers mentioned to us before they found Juji, they had explored 20+ chatbot platforms but failed to find the one that meets their needs. 


To help businesses expedite their chatbot platform selection process, here we share the tips on how to quickly evaluate AI chatbot platforms and make a selection based on business needs and the relevant key technical and business factors to consider.

## I﻿dentify the type of chatbot based on your business needs

First of all, business needs dictate which type of chatbot is needed. 

To select a chatbot platform, the very first step is to understand why you need a chatbot and the expected tasks to be performed by the chatbot. You can then identify the type of chatbot that is needed. Based on the main tasks to be accomplished, chatbots can be roughly categorized into three types:

### 1. Q﻿uestion-Answering Chatbots (QA Chatbots)

The main task for these chatbots is to answer user questions based on public and/or proprietary information. For example, universities may use a chatbot on their website to answer student questions about learning programs (see Image 1.1 below), or hospitals may use a chatbot in their mobile app to answer patient questions on medical services. Very similar to the behavior of #ChatGPT, this type of chatbot is typically driven by user questions and assumes that all questions can be answered in a SINGLE response (see image 3 below for contrasting questions that cannot be answered in one response).

### 2﻿. Question-Asking Chatbots (Survey/Interview Chatbots)

The main task for these chatbots is to ask user questions and gather information from an intended audience. Very similar to an online survey, this type of chatbot has been used to gather information for research studies, personality assessments, and job interviews (Image 1.2 provides an example of this type of chatbot). Typically, this type of chatbot is NOT capable of answering user questions including clarification questions during the process.
