Are you considering an AI chatbot for your business? A simple Google search will present you with hundreds if not thousands of AI chatbot platforms!  Almost all of them claim that they are powered by generative AI and all seem to offer similar features, giving the first impression that any of them would do the job. 

In reality, not every chatbot platform is created equal or is a perfect fit for the tasks you have at hand. For example, many of our customers mentioned to us before they found Juji, they had explored 20+ chatbot platforms but failed to find the one that meets their needs. 

To help you expedite your chatbot platform selection process, in this article we will first identify different types of chatbots for businesses. Then we will dive into each type of chatbot and list the relevant key technical and business factors you should consider when evaluating different AI chatbot platforms for supporting the specific type of chatbot.

## I﻿dentify the type of chatbot based on your business needs

First of all, business needs dictate which type of chatbot is needed. 

To select a chatbot platform, the very first step is to understand why you need a chatbot and the expected tasks to be performed by the chatbot. You can then identify the type of chatbot that is needed. Based on the main tasks to be accomplished, chatbots can be roughly categorized into three types:

### 1. Q﻿uestion-Answering Chatbots (QA Chatbots)

The main task for these chatbots is to answer user questions based on public and/or proprietary information. For example, universities may use a chatbot on their website to answer student questions about learning programs (see Image 1.1 below), or hospitals may use a chatbot in their mobile app to answer patient questions on medical services. Very similar to the behavior of #ChatGPT, this type of chatbot is typically driven by user questions and assumes that all questions can be answered in a SINGLE response (see image 3 below for contrasting questions that cannot be answered in one response).

### 2﻿. Question-Asking Chatbots (Survey/Interview Chatbots)

The main task for these chatbots is to ask user questions and gather information from an intended audience. Very similar to an online survey, this type of chatbot has been used to gather information for research studies, personality assessments, and job interviews (Image 1.2 provides an example of this type of chatbot). Typically, this type of chatbot is NOT capable of answering user questions including clarification questions during the process.

### 3﻿. Proactive, Two-Way Conversational Chatbots (Proactive Chatbots)

In real-world applications, chatbots often need to perform multiple tasks simultaneously to deliver desired user experience and accomplish the business objectives. For example, a QA only chatbot on a university website may be inadequate because the same chatbot must also ask visitor questions to gather necessary information before they can answer the visitor questions (see Image 1.3 below). Similarly, a survey only chatbot for job interviews may be unsatisfactory because it must also answer candidate questions regarding the positions and the organization during the interview. This third type of chatbot is a hybrid of the QA and survey chatbots, capable of both asking and answering questions during a conversation, known as Proactive Chatbots. 

## B﻿uilding QA Chatbots

Here we outline 3 key factors to consider when selecting an AI chatbot platform to build a Question-Answering Chatbot (QA Chatbot). 

### A﻿nswer quality and quality control

A QA chatbot's main job is to answer user questions. When evaluating an AI chatbot platform, the first factor is to evaluate how well the platform enables a chatbot to answer user questions accurately with no or minimum AI hallucinations. Unfortunately, the direct use of generative AI technologies, like Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), can't always guarantee high-quality AI responses because of their probabilistic nature. Therefore, ask the following questions during evaluation:

* How does your AI platform ensure the quality of AI responses, e.g., avoiding AI hallucinations? 
* What kind of control measures can humans use to fine-tune AI responses (see examples in Image 2.1 and 2.2 below)?

### H﻿andling complex Q&A

Most AI chatbots powered by generative AI can answer simple questions—questions that can be answered with a single response. However, if a business requires a chatbot to handle complex user questions, it is important to evaluate how well an AI chatbot platform can support complex Q&A. In particular, ask the following questions during the evaluation: 

* Can your AI platform handle complex Q&A, which involves multi-step interactions between a chatbot and a user (see Image 2.3 below for an example)?
* Who will define and manage the complex Q&A and how? For example, during a complex Q&A, the user may ask another complex or simple Q&A, how will it be handled?
