## 3 Challenges in Academic Advising and How AI Can Help

Academic advisors play a crucial role in guiding students through their educational journey, providing support in course selection, academic policies, and career opportunities. With limited staffing resources relative to the growing number of students requiring individualized guidance, advisors often manage large caseloads, which leads to several challenges. Thanks to Gabe Bermea, Ed.D., a higher ed expert, whose article “[Redefining Academic Advising: The Rise of AI-Powered Technologies](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/redefining-academic-advising-rise-ai-powered-part-i-bermea-ed-d-)” outlines how the adoption of AI can address these challenges.

Due to the large number of students, advisors often have to keep their meetings brief and focused on immediate issues, resulting in conversations that are more transactional rather than transformational.

### A﻿I Solution: Scale Up Academic Advising

AI can provide advice to students 24/7, allowing advisors to scale their services and increase accessibility. This enables advisors to allocate more time for in-depth, transformational conversations with students, enhancing the advising experience.

### C﻿hallenge 2: Limited Personalization

The large number of students and limited resources make it difficult for advisors to provide personalized attention, affecting the quality of advice and support.
