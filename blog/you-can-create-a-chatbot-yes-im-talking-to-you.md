Have you ever thought, "Creating a chatbot seems too technical and beyond my capabilities" or "I don't have the coding abilities necessary to create a chatbot"? What if I told you there's a platform called Juji, where you don't need to code? 

Yes, no coding necessary. Period.

On Juji, you can easily edit the flow of a conversation and can add frequently asked questions (FAQs) through text boxes. It's as easy as posting, editing, and sending your content on social media. 

For example, you can edit the already-generated welcome message by clicking on the "Welcome" text box and start editing your greeting. 

To get an idea of how you can do this on Juji and to get started on building your own bot, we invite you to take view our "DIY Your First Chatbot" tutorial video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkI9c4iBwl8
